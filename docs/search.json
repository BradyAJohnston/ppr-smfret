Everything should have been basically the same as it was previously, the only thing that would be different is the age of the protein, but why that would affect a single dye (AF647) I don’t know, so I don’t think that is the actual cause.\nThe only other thing that I can think of that is different, is that the AF647 was previously suspended in Milli-Q water, but this time I dissolved it into 100% DMSO. I will have to double check what I wrote in the lab-book for the previous labelling procedure. I wouldn’t think that it would make a difference, but it seems that it might.\nI still conducted the labelling reaction in 5% DMSO like I did previously, so I still don’t know how it would have made a difference in the final reaction having been solubilised in DMSO and not water despite being soluble in both."

It seems that with BSA and both dyes present, they labelled similarly, but in the case of dsnPPR10, when there was Cy3 added it basically didn’t label at all.\nThe presence of Cy3 is outcompeting the labelling of the dsnPPR10-C2, but not BSA?\nNormalised Concentrations\nTo properly compare the presence of either dye, the ‘relative concentration’ was calculated according to the Beer-Lambert law (Equation 1 ).\n\\[\nA = \\epsilon b C\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhere \\(A\\) is the absorbance (\\(AU\\)), \\(\\epsilon\\) is the extinction coefficient (\\(cm^{-1}M^{-1}\\)), \\(b\\) is the path length (\\(cm\\)) and \\(C\\) is the concentration (\\(molL^{-1}\\)).
